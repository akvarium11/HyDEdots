// You can prevent Sober from launching by improperly formatting this file's JSON, or possibly mess up the Roblox engine by toggling certain flags intended for Roblox engineers.
// **If you got Fastflags from an FFlag guide, Reddit post, AI model, or a YouTuber, you shouldn't be here, and the FFlags provided are likely made up. We will not provide support for any bugs caused by Fastflag usage.**
// Incase you mess up, you can reset this file by deleting it. It will be recreated the next time you launch Sober.
